# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

This repository documents my personal Python learning experience through a mixture of two excellent YouTube resources:

- [Bro Code - Python Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix9cRaBkVe0)
- [Kasey Nguyen - Python Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyziQOfLjkM&list=PL2W-cwk5hZgT6tJSe__nz6hvZly57kzOK)

## 📘 Overview

This self-paced course covers Python fundamentals to intermediate topics, with hands-on code and examples based on tutorials from both channels. The learning journey is organized into thematic sections, blending theory with practice and real-world examples.
